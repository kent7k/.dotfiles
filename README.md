# .dotfiles

The author organizes the development environment setup into four main
categories:

- **Terminal**: zsh, tmux, nvim, and other tools like emulators and prompts
- **Infrastructure**: Git, AWS/GCP, and more
- **Language**: JavaScript, Python, and others
- **Package**: fzf, asdf, and more

These directories are located within `.dotfiles/.zsh`.

## Zsh

- Uses Zinit as the base.
- Implements autocompletion with Fig.
- All shells are written directly in the `.zsh` file of this repository for
  reusability and long-term maintenance.
- Does not use Alfred's workflow, Fig's scripts, or similar tools.

## Terminal

- Tmux
- **Editor**: IntelliJ (WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.)
